This is my first web project I have done without a tutorial to follow in my journy to learn Javascript, CSS, and HTML. It was to see if I could make a functional web page and I have succeded in that. I did face challenges in getting the list of colors and their alpha values to work, but I was able t find and create solutions that work well. It is simple but I am pleased with the results.
